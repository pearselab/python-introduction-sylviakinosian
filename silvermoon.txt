Silvermoon City is the capital of the blood elves, 
located in the northeastern part of the Eversong Woods 
within the kingdom of Quel'Thalas, at the northernmost tip 
of the Eastern Kingdoms. The breathtaking capital city of the blood 
elves may rival the dwarven capital of Ironforge 
as the world's oldest, still standing, capital.
